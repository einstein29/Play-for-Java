# README #

I am learning Play framework through studying this book [Play for Java](https://www.manning.com/books/play-for-java) ([Terms of Use](https://www.manning.com/terms-of-use)). It was written based on version 2.2.0 which is outdated and the source code provided can not be utilized directly. Therefore, I modified the code so that it matches v2.5.x.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Source code for Play v2.5.x. It saves your time from googling around since most of them are just syntax issues.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Creating a play project.
* Only modified files are uploaded, so copy and paste files into your own project and run.


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin.
